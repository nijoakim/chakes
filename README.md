# Chakes /tʃɑ-kə‘s/ #
This, my friend, is chakes. A game unlike much of what you have seen before. (This is because you see _a lot_ of things in your life, and most of those other things are quite unlike chakes.)

## The quick introduction ##
Chakes is like chess, with a twist. Chakes is very much a turn-based chess game and I daresay it is _more_ turn-based than ordinary chess. You see in chakes, each piece can take its turn concurrently with all the other pieces! That is, as soon as you move a piece you are allowed to move again, just not that particular one until a while.

Imagine if you will the rush and thrill of your favorite real-time tactics game (Starcraft?) combined with the serenity, calm venerable history of shāh.
